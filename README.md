# Personal Media Cleanup
This is a simple media cleanup python code. I wrote this to help sift through the thousands of personal pictures and videos I have offline.

It accepts two parameters, input and output. If the input directory does not exist it will fail, if the output does it exist, it will create it.

The output is structured into 3 top level directories. For the photos and videos, it will sort them into year/month directories.

- Photos
- Videos
- Non Media Files
